# Dealing with Images and Processing in OpenCV

This repository provides examples and code implementations for dealing with images and performing various image processing tasks using OpenCV.

## Introduction

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that provides various functions and algorithms for image and video processing. It is widely used in the field of computer vision and offers a wide range of capabilities for manipulating and analyzing images.

This repository aims to demonstrate the usage of OpenCV for handling images and performing common image processing operations. It provides practical examples and code snippets that can be used as a reference for image processing tasks.

## Features

The repository includes the following features and functionalities:

1. Image Loading and Display: Learn how to load and display images using OpenCV.
2. Image Manipulation: Explore various image manipulation techniques such as resizing, cropping, rotating, and flipping images.
3. Color Manipulation: Understand how to modify the color channels of an image, convert between different color spaces, and apply color filters.
4. Image Filtering and Enhancement: Learn how to apply various filters and enhancements to images, such as blurring, sharpening, and histogram equalization.
5. Feature Detection and Extraction: Discover techniques for detecting and extracting features from images, such as edges, corners, and keypoints.
6. Image Segmentation: Explore methods for segmenting images into meaningful regions or objects.
7. Object Detection and Recognition: Learn how to perform object detection and recognition tasks using OpenCV's pre-trained models or custom models.

## Requirements

To run the code and execute the image processing tasks, the following dependencies are required:

- OpenCV: The computer vision library used for image processing.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for running and modifying the provided notebooks.

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python jupyter
```
